# Unofficial Mods for the Game Starri

**Nothing in this org or repos is affiliated with the game Starri or its developers NEX Team. This is unofficial and just for fun!**

This is a tiny collection of **experimental** mods for the game Starri: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1940410/Starri/

Since there are no mods yet, I thought I'd try to throw some code together to add some features I'd love to have in the game.  
I've set this place up to have it all at one place - maybe more will follow in the future(:

# Disclaimer

- **Nothing in this org or repos is not affiliated with the game Starri or its developers NEX Team. This is unofficial and just for fun!**
- No support for cheating, unlocking songs for free or anything like that. Anything in here is just to make the game even more fun and maybe even more popular.
- This is experimental! I'm not a software developer. Most of this code is created by ChatGPT and hacked together by me, while trying to figure out how the toolchain works.
- The mods are provided as-is. Use at your own risk!

# Usage of the Mods

# Credits and Inspiration

Anything in here is inspired by the lovely [Muse Dash Modding Community](https://github.com/MDMods). Hanging around on their Discord sparked my interest in modding.
